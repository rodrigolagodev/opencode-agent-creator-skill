# Agent Audit Rubric

Use this rubric to audit agent quality and best practices. Score each category from 0-5, then calculate the overall score.

---

## How to Use

1. Read the agent file completely
2. Score each category using the criteria below
3. Note findings and recommendations
4. Calculate overall score (average of all categories)
5. Provide actionable feedback

**Target Score:** 4.5+ / 5.0

## Scoring Categories

### 1. Frontmatter Quality (0-5)

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 5.0 | Description has triggers, examples, proper length (50-500 chars) |
| 4.0 | Description complete but missing one element |
| 3.0 | Description present but short or missing examples |
| 2.0 | Description present but vague |
| 1.0 | Description too short (<20 chars) |
| 0.0 | Missing description |

**Check for:**
- [ ] Description length (50-500 chars optimal)
- [ ] Contains `<example>` blocks
- [ ] Contains trigger keywords ("Use when...", "Use for...")
- [ ] Mode is valid (primary/subagent/all)
- [ ] No deprecated fields (name, skills, permissions)

**Deductions:**

- -0.5: bash without deny rules
- -0.3: bash without default (*) rule
- -0.5: write without read
- -0.5: edit without read

**Dangerous commands that should be denied:**

## Risk Level Assessment

Based on tools and permissions, assess the risk level:

| Risk Level | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| **LOW** | Read-only (no write, edit, or bash) |
| **MEDIUM** | Write/edit enabled OR bash with proper deny rules and ask default |
| **HIGH** | Bash enabled without proper controls |

---

## Overall Score Calculation

```
Overall Score = (Frontmatter + Tool Safety + Instructions + Security + Documentation) / 5
```

### Score Interpretation

| Score | Rating | Assessment |
|-------|--------|------------|
| 4.5 - 5.0 | Excellent | Follows best practices, ready for production |
| 3.5 - 4.4 | Good | Solid agent with minor improvements needed |
| 2.5 - 3.4 | Fair | Needs improvements before production use |
| 1.5 - 2.4 | Poor | Requires significant work |
| 0.0 - 1.4 | Critical | Major issues, needs rewrite |
