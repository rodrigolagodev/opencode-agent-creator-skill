## Code Reviewer

### Purpose
Analyze code quality, identify issues, suggest improvements without making changes.

### Frontmatter Pattern
```yaml
---
description: >-
  Analyzes code for quality, performance, and best practices.
  Read-only reviews with detailed feedback.
  
  Use when asked to review code quality, check for bugs, or analyze architecture.
  
  <example>
  User: "Review this component for issues"
  Assistant: "I'll use `code-reviewer` to analyze it."
  </example>

mode: subagent

tools:
  read: true
  glob: true
  grep: true
  skill: true
  todoread: true
  todowrite: true
---
```

> **Note:** Load skills at runtime using the `skill` tool. For example, load 
> `vercel-react-best-practices` when reviewing React code.

### Tool Selection Rationale
- **read**: Examine code files
- **glob/grep**: Find files and patterns to review
- **skill**: Reference best practices during review
- **todo**: Track review findings across multiple files
- **NO write/edit**: Prevents accidental modifications (review only)
- **NO bash**: No system access needed for review

### Core Instruction Structure
```markdown
## Core Responsibilities
1. Analyze code quality and architecture
2. Identify bugs, anti-patterns, and security issues
3. Suggest improvements with examples
4. Reference best practices from loaded skills

## Review Process
1. Understand the codebase structure
2. Create todo list for files to review
3. Analyze each file systematically
4. Provide detailed, actionable feedback
5. Prioritize findings by severity

## Review Categories
- Code Quality (readability, maintainability)
- Performance (inefficiencies, optimization opportunities)
- Security (vulnerabilities, unsafe patterns)
- Best Practices (framework-specific guidelines)
- Architecture (structure, separation of concerns)
```

### When to Use This Pattern
- Code review workflows
- Pre-commit quality checks
- Learning/mentoring scenarios
- Architecture audits

  Read-only security analysis with severity classification.
  
  Use when reviewing authentication, authorization, or handling sensitive data.
  
  <example>
  User: "Audit this login endpoint for security issues"
  Assistant: "I'll use `security-auditor` to review it."
  </example>

mode: subagent

tools:
  read: true
  glob: true
  grep: true
  skill: true
  webfetch: true
  todoread: true
  todowrite: true
---
```

> **Note:** Load `security-review` skill at runtime for security best practices and checklists.

### Tool Selection Rationale
- **read**: Examine code for security issues
- **glob/grep**: Find sensitive patterns (API keys, auth code, etc.)
- **skill**: Reference security best practices
- **webfetch**: Check CVE databases, security advisories
- **todo**: Track findings by severity
- **NO write/edit/bash**: Audit only, no modifications

### Core Instruction Structure
```markdown
## Core Responsibilities
1. Identify security vulnerabilities and unsafe patterns
2. Check for exposed secrets and credentials
3. Analyze authentication and authorization logic
4. Review input validation and sanitization
5. Check dependency vulnerabilities

## Security Audit Process
1. Scan for exposed secrets (.env, hardcoded keys)
2. Review authentication mechanisms
3. Analyze authorization and access control
4. Check input validation and SQL injection risks
5. Review cryptography usage
6. Check for XSS, CSRF vulnerabilities
7. Analyze dependency security

## Severity Classification
- CRITICAL: Immediate security risk (exposed secrets, SQL injection)
- HIGH: Significant vulnerability (weak auth, missing validation)
- MEDIUM: Security weakness (missing HTTPS, weak crypto)
- LOW: Best practice violation (missing security headers)
```

### When to Use This Pattern

## Combining Patterns

You can combine elements from multiple patterns for hybrid agents:

### Example: Full-Stack Developer
```yaml
---
description: >-
  Full-stack developer for end-to-end feature implementation.
  Handles frontend, backend, and database work.
  
  <example>

  </example>

mode: primary

tools:
  bash: true
  read: true
  write: true
  edit: true
  glob: true
  grep: true
  skill: true
  todoread: true
  todowrite: true

permission:
  bash:
    "*": ask
    "npm *": allow
    "git status*": allow
---
```

> **Note:** Load skills as needed: `vercel-react-best-practices` for frontend,
> `backend-patterns` for API, `security-review` for auth flows.

### Example: Security-Aware Developer
```yaml
---
description: >-
